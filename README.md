# Bare-Metal Embedded Programming

## Reference Video

## Description
This video introduces the concept of bare-metal embedded programming,
where firmware runs directly on microcontroller hardware without the
support of an operating system.

It explains why bare-metal systems are commonly used in embedded
applications and how direct control over hardware enables deterministic
behavior and efficient resource usage.

## Topics Explained
- Definition of bare-metal embedded systems
- Difference between bare-metal and OS-based systems
- Direct interaction with CPU, memory, and peripherals
- Absence of scheduling, virtual memory, and system services

## Key Points
- Bare-metal firmware executes directly after reset
- All hardware initialization is handled by the developer
- Memory and peripherals are accessed through fixed addresses
- Understanding bare-metal concepts is mandatory before learning
  registers, GPIO, and peripheral drivers
